# RyanSemanticShowcase

This project demonstrates semantic HTML that is styled with CSS.

## Description

This webpage is created with HTML and styled with CSS. The source code was provided by a marketing agency, and our challenge was to refactor the existing site to make it more accessible. We accomplished this by adding semantic HTML, which serves to enhance the structure and meaning of the webpage via specific tags that have semantic meaning. Semantic HTML provides meaning about the content displayed and the structure of the webpage, which is meaningful to browsers, SEO optimization, developers, and for accessibility needs.
